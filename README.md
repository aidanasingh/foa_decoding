# FOA Binaural Decoding

This repository includes a jupyter notebook and associated files for evaluating different virtual speaker arrays for first order ambisonic decoding, including spatially oversampled arrays.

Alternative to compiling the jupyter notebook, this repository has select wav files that were rendered using the associated software.

This repository includes Neuman KU 100 HRIR's from the SADIE II Dataset, and a 'single source' file from the 3D-MARCo dataset.
